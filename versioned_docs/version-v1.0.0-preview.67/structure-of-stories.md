# 📂 Structure of "stories"

- The `[Stories]` attribute on a Razor component indicates to the Blazing Story runtime that the Razor component will include stories.
- The slash-separated title string of the parameter of the `[Stories]` attribute configures the navigation tree and represents the title of the stories container (we called it "Component").
- The `<Stories>` component indicates to the Blazing Story runtime what is the target component of the story with its `TComponent` type parameter. The "Controls" panel will be built from this component-type information.
- The `<Stories>` component can include one or more `<Story>` components. The `<Story>` component has the `Name` parameter, which will be shown in the sidebar navigation tree to identify each story.
- The `<Template>` render fragment parameter inside the `<Story>` component will be rendered in the canvas area when that story is selected in the sidebar navigation tree.
- The Blazing Story runtime passes the parameters users inputted from the "Control" panel through the `context.Args` inside the `<Template>` render fragment, so you should apply it to the component by using the `@attributes=...`,  [attribute splatting syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components/#attribute-splatting-and-arbitrary-parameters).
