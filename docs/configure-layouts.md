# ‚öôÔ∏è Configure layouts

If you want to apply the same layout for every story, you can specify the layout component to use when displaying a story. This architecture is mostly the same as Blazor's standard layout mechanism (see also: _["ASP.NET Core Blazor layouts | Microsoft Learn"](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components/layouts)_). A layout component must inherit from the `LayoutComponentBase` class and should have the rendering `@Body` in its markup. If you apply the layout component like the one below to stories,

```html
@inherits LayoutComponentBase
<YourThemeProvider>
    <div style="padding: 24px;">
        @Body
    </div>
</YourThemeProvider>
```

The story which applied the layout component above will be rendered as a child component of the `<YourThemeProvider>` component (imagine you implemented that component such a component including some cascading values) and will have 24-pixel padding.

## Application level layout

The specified layout component for stories is in multiple levels.

First, you can specify the layout for the application level via the `DefaultLayout` property of the `BlazingStoryApp` component, which is usually marked up in your `App.razor` file.

```html
@* üìÑApp.razor *@
<BlazingStoryApp ... DefaultLayout="typeof(DefaultLayout)">
</BlazingStoryApp>
```

In the above case, the layout component `DefaultLayout.razor` will be used when displaying every story.

## Component (Stories) level layout

```html
@* üìÑApp.razor *@
<BlazingStoryApp ... DefaultLayout="typeof(DefaultLayout)">
</BlazingStoryApp>
```

In the above case, the layout component `DefaultLayout.razor` will be used when displaying every story.

## Component (Stories) level layout

Second, you can specify the layout for the component (stories) level via the `Layout` parameter of the `<Stories>` component.

```html
@* üìÑ...stories.razor *@
@attribute [Stories(...)]

<Stories ... Layout="typeof(StoriesLayout)">
    ...
```

In the above case, when displaying stories within the `<Stories>` markup, the layout component `StoriesLayout.razor` will be utilized.

## Story level layout

Third, you can specify the layout for the story level via the `Layout` parameter of the `<Story>` component.

```html
@* üìÑ...stories.razor *@
@attribute [Stories(...)]

<Stories ...>
    <Story Name="..." Layout="typeof(StoryLayout)">
        ...
```

In the above case, when displaying the story named "...", the layout component `StoryLayout.razor` will be utilized.

## The order of applying the layouts

The order of applying the layout component is the application level layout will use on the outermost level, and the story level layout will use on the innermost level. The component (stories) level layout will use on the middle level of them.
