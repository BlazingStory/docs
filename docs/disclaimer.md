# ðŸ™‡ Disclaimer

The "Blazing Story" is just my hobby work and a personal technical exhibition, so it is not an officially derived product from the "Storybook". I'd like to keep improving this product for now, but it might be abandoned if I cannot spend enough time on this product in the future. I welcome that somebody forks this product and organizes the maintainers for it.

From another perspective, the "Blazing Story" is an almost 100% Blazor-native application that re-implemented  Storybook's look, behavior, and functionality to mimic it. However, this means that **none of the Storybook community's contributions, numerous add-ins, and related services are available in the "Blazing Story"**.

Therefore, the combination of Blazor's WebComponents custom element and Storybook might be more promising for the future of UI component catalog solutions for Blazor application development than the "Blazing Story".

However, on the "Blazing Story" side, Blazor application developers can get a Storybook-like UI component catalog solution under the familiar .NET ecosystem without being annoyed by a complex JavaScript front-end development toolchain. This is the most important point I wanted to illustrate through the development of Blazing Story.
