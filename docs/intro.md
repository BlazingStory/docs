# ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/main/assets/icon.min.64x64.svg) Blazing Story

The clone of ["Storybook"](https://storybook.js.org/) for Blazor, a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/main/assets/social-preview.png)](https://jsakamoto.github.io/BlazingStory/)

The "Blazing Story" is built on **almost 100% Blazor native** (except only a few JavaScript helper codes), so you don't have to care about `npm`, `package.json`, `webpack`, and any JavaScript/TypeScript code. You can create a UI catalog application **on the Blazor way!**

In addition, Blazing Story also provides an **MCP server feature.** This allows Blazing Story to expose information about its components and stories to AI agents, enabling highly accurate code generation.

You can try it out from the live demonstration site at the following link: https://jsakamoto.github.io/BlazingStory/

# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
