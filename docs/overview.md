# ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsakamoto/BlazingStory/main/assets/icon.min.64x64.svg) Blazing Story

The clone of ["Storybook"](https://storybook.js.org/) for Blazor, a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation.

The "Blazing Story" is built on **almost 100% Blazor native** (except only a few JavaScript helper codes), so you don't have to care about `npm`, `package.json`, `webpack`, and any JavaScript/TypeScript code. You can create a UI catalog application **on the Blazor way!**

In addition, Blazing Story also provides an **MCP server feature.** This allows Blazing Story to expose information about its components and stories to AI agents, enabling highly accurate code generation.

You can try it out from the live demonstration site at the following link: https://jsakamoto.github.io/BlazingStory/
